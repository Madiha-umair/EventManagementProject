# Event Management
##### Introducing my latest project - an innovative event management application built using PHP, CSS, HTML, and MySQL. This dynamic website offers two interfaces - a user-friendly front-end for attendees to browse events, view event details, and submit contact forms, as well as a comprehensive back-end that provides administrators with the tools they need to manage events, attendees, and much more. With three main pages, including event listings, event details, and a contact form, this application is designed to streamline the event management process and provide attendees with an exceptional user experience. Whether you're planning a small corporate event or a large-scale conference, this application is the perfect tool to help you manage your event efficiently and effectively.

# A Basic Vanilla PHP CMS

This repository is a simple PHP CMS meant to be used as a starting point. The code consists of a simple login process, a dashboard, a place to view/add/edit/delete users, and a place to view/add/edit/delete projects. In an effort to keep the PHP code focused and basic, only the absolute basics have been included. The whole CMS only consists of HTML, PHP, and SQL.

A few notes regarding the CMS:

- There is no form validation
- Security is very basic
- Image uploading is done through a separate page using a basic servers-side script
- Images are stored in the database as a base64 string
- Image resizing is done through [WideImage](http://wideimage.sourceforge.net/) (you'll need to add this to the includes folder)
